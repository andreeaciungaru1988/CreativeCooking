I will use Desing Thinking Process with just four phases, empathize, define, ideate and prototype 
For stage 1 I will interview 5 people passionate about cooking to gain an empathetic understanding of the problem that I am trying to solve
In stage 2, I will analyze observations, define problem statements and create personas
